/**
 * The idea here is that there are the following levels:<ul>
 * <li> Run-specific objects, such as {@link QSimConfigGroup}, {@link EventsManager}, etc.  These are in general guice-injected, but can
 * also be configured by the constructor.  In the longer run, I would like to get rid of {@link Scenario}, but I haven't checked where
 * it us truly needed yet.
 * <li> Mobsim-specific objects, such as {@link AgentCounter} or {@link QNetsimEngine}.  Since the mobsim is re-created in every
 * iteration, they cannot be injected via guice, at least not via the global inject mechanism that has the override facility.
 * <li> The last level are link- oder node-specific objects such as {@link Link}  or {@QNode}.  They are arguments to the 
 * creational methods.
 * <li> The main underlying implementations are {@link QueueWithBuffer}, the factory of which is inserted into {@link QLinkImpl}.  This
 * was the syntax that could subsume all other syntactic variants.  Builders are used to set defaults and to avoid overly long
 * constructors.
 * <li> {@link QLinkImpl} is essentially the container where vehicles are parked, agents perform activities, etc.  MATSim has some tendency to
 * have them centralized in the QSim (see, e.g., {@link TransitStopAgentTracker}), but both for parallel computing and for visualization, 
 * having agents on a decentralized location is helpful.  
 * <li> Most functionality of {@link QLinkImpl} is actually in {@link AbstractQLink}, which
 * can also be used as basic infrastructure by other qnetworks.  
 * <li> {@link QueueWithBuffer} is an instance of {@link QLaneI} and can be replaced accordingly.  
 * <li> One can also replace the {@link VehicleQ} that works inside {@link QueueWithBuffer}. 
 * </ul>
